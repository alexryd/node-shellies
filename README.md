# node-shellies
[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/shellies.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shellies)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexryd/node-shellies.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexryd/node-shellies)

Handles communication with [Shelly](https://shelly.cloud) devices, using both
[CoAP](http://coap.technology) and HTTP.

## Features
* Automatically detects Shelly devices (on the same network and subnet).
* Automatically detects when the status of a device changes, such as when a
  relay is turned on or off.
* Keeps track of devices and if they go offline (because no status update has
  been received in a given amount of time).

### Notes
<sup>1</sup> Requires setting the `Internet & Security -> CoIoT -> Remote
address` option on the Shelly device to the IP address of your device running
node-shellies.

## Basic usage example
```javascript
const shellies = require('shellies')

shellies.on('discover', device => {
  // a new device has been discovered
  console.log('Discovered device with ID', device.id, 'and type', device.type)

  device.on('change', (prop, newValue, oldValue) => {
    // a property on the device has changed
    console.log(prop, 'changed from', oldValue, 'to', newValue)
  })

  device.on('offline', () => {
    // the device went offline
    console.log('Device with ID', device.id, 'went offline')
  })
})

// start discovering devices and listening for status updates
shellies.start()
```
